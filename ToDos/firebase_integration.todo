            ☐ - - upload.go: Initiates the file upload by calling gRPC's `UploadFile` method.

FLOW:
    ☐ firebase/firebase.go: FIREBASE INITIALIZATION
        - Define `InitializeFirebase` function for Firebase app initialization in firebase/firebase.go.

    ☐ firebase/upload.go: STORAGE LOGIC
        - Create `UploadFileToFirebase` function in firebase/upload.go to handle the specific logic for uploading files to Firebase Storage. Utilize `InitializeFirebase` for Firebase app setup.

    ☐ void/server.go: SERVER INITIALIZATION
        - It calls `InitializeFirebase` function from firebase/firebase.go because this makes sure that the Firebase app is initialized before we try to upload a file to Firebase Storage & it ensures that your server is ready to interact with Firebase.

    ☐ void/server.go: GRPC SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION & GRPC IMPLEMENTATION
        - Initialize Firebase using `InitializeFirebase` to ensure proper setup before interactions with Firebase.
    
        - Implement gRPC's `UploadFile` method here. 
        - Within `UploadFile`, call `UploadFileToFirebase` to handle the actual file upload to Firebase Storage.
    
    ☐ void/cmd/upload.go: COMMAND EXECUTION
        - In the command file (upload.go), initiate file uploads by calling gRPC's `UploadFile` method.
        


+------+
cmd invoked by user --> sends a req to gRPC server [void/server.go] --> gRPC server calls `UploadFile` method --> `UploadFile` calls `UploadFileToFirebase` to handle the actual file upload to Firebase Storage.
